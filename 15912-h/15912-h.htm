    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>"Nobody knows," says a Berlin message, "how near the
    <span class="sc">Kapp</span> counter-revolution came to being a
    success." A kind word from Commander
    <span class="sc">Kenworthy</span>, it is believed, would have
    made all the difference.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is reported that Miss <span class="sc">Isobel
    Elsom</span>, the cinema star, tried to get knocked down by a
    taxi-cab for the purposes of a film, but failed. We can only
    suppose that the driver must have been new to his job.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A vicar has written to the Press complaining indignantly of
    a London firm's offer to supply sermons at five shillings each.
    We are not surprised. Five shillings is a lot of money to give
    for a sermon.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Llangollen Golf Club has decided to allow Sunday golf.
    In extenuation it is pointed out that the Welsh for "stymied"
    does not constitute a breach of the Sabbath, as is the case
    with the Scots equivalent.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At Caterham a robin has built its nest in a bully beef tin.
    These are the little things that give the Disposals Board a bad
    name.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A North of Ireland man who has just died at the age of 107
    boasted that he had never had a bath. This should silence the
    faddists who pretend that they can hardly wait till Saturday
    night.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The ruins of Whitby Abbey, it is announced, are to be
    presented by their owner to the nation. On the other hand, the
    report that Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> intends to
    present the ruins of the Liberal Party to Manchester City is
    not confirmed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The latest information is that the recent German revolution
    had to be abandoned owing to the weather.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>From a weekly paper article we gather that the
    trousers-crease will be in its accustomed frontal position this
    year. It is unfortunate that this announcement should have
    clashed with the attempted restoration of the Monarchy in
    Berlin.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Hot Cross Buns will probably cost threepence this year. An
    economical plan is for the householder to make his own hot
    cross and then get the local confectioner to fit a bun to
    it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"There will be no whisky in Scotland in the year 1925," says
    a Prohibitionist speaker. He did not say whether there will be
    any Scotsmen.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>No arrangement has yet been made for the carrying on of the
    Food Ministry, though it is said that one food profiteer has
    offered to buy the place as a memento.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"All the great men are dead," states a London newspaper.
    This sly dig at Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill's</span> robust
    health is surely in bad taste.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are glad to hear that the strap-hanger who was summoned
    by a fellow-passenger on the Underground Railway for refusing
    to remove his foot from off the plaintiff's toes has now been
    acquitted by the jury. It appears that he was able to prove
    that he was not in a position to do so as his was not the top
    foot of the heap.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to a trade journal the latest fashion in umbrellas
    is a pigeon's head carved on the handle. This, we understand,
    is the first step towards a really reliable homing
    umbrella.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The appearance of a hen blackbird without any trace of
    feathers on its neck or back is reported by a Worcester
    ornithologist. The attempt on the part of this bird to follow
    our present fashions is most interesting.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>So much difficulty is being experienced in deciding whose
    incendiary bullet was the most effective, that it is thought
    possible that the Government may arrange for the Zeppelin raids
    to be revived.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A society paper reports that a large number of millionaires
    are now staying on the Riviera. It is not known where the other
    shareholders of <span class="sc">Coats's</span> are
    staying.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In order to influence the exchange a contemporary suggests
    that we should sell our treasures to America. We understand
    that a cable to New York asking what they are prepared to pay
    for Mr. <span class="sc">Ramsay MacDonald</span> remains
    unanswered.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An egg weighing nine-and-a-half ounces has been laid at
    Bayonne, France. It looks like a walk-over unless <i>The
    Spectator</i> has something up its sleeve.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"One hears the crying of the new-born lambs on all sides,"
    writes a Nature correspondent. On the other hand the
    unmistakable bubbling note of the mint-sauce will not be heard
    for another month or so.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Will the A.S.C. private who in 1917 was ordered to take a
    mule to Sutton Coldfield please note that the animal has been
    sighted in California still chewing an army tunic, but the
    badges are missing?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"So many letters are being lost in the post nowadays,"
    states a daily paper, "that drastic action should be taken in
    the matter." We understand that the
    <span class="sc">Postmaster-General</span> has expressed his
    willingness to be searched.</p>

    <h2>A FLAT TO LET.</h2>

    <p>It was twelve o'clock (noon) and I was sitting over the fire
    in our squalid lodgings reading the attractive advertisements
    of country mansions in a weekly journal. I had just decided on
    a delightful Tudor manor-house with every modern convenience, a
    nice little park and excellent fishing and shooting, when Betty
    burst upon me like a whirlwind.</p>

    <p>Her face was flushed and a fierce light shone in her usually
    mild blue eyes. She looked like a Mænad or the incarnation of
    Victory at a bargain sale.</p>

    <p>"Come on," she gasped, seizing me by the arm. "Hurry."</p>

    <p>"Good heavens! Is the house on fire? My child! Let me save
    my child."</p>

    <p>"Oh, do come on," cried Betty; "there's not a moment to be
    lost."</p>

    <p>"But how can I come on in slippers?" I demanded. "If I may
    not save the young Henry Augustus, at any rate let me put on my
    boots."</p>

    <p>Betty's only reply was to drag me from the room, hustle me
    through the hall, where I dexterously caught my hat from the
    stand in passing, and thrust me into the street.</p>

    <p>"I've got a flat," she panted. "That is, I've got it if
    we're quick enough. Hi, taxi!"</p>

    <p>"But, my dear," I remonstrated as the taxi-driver, cowed by
    the look in her eye, drew up to the kerb, "if we take a taxi we
    shan't have anything left to pay for the flat."</p>

    <p>"Victory Mansions, Trebarwith Road. Drive fast!" shouted
    Betty as she pushed me into the cab.</p>

    <p>"Now you've done it," I said bitterly. "Do you know I've
    only five pounds ten on me at the moment? We shall lose the
    flat while we're quarrelling with the driver."</p>

    <p>"Oh, dear," cried Betty, "can't you see that this is
    serious? It was a wonderful piece of luck. I was passing the
    mansions and I happened to look up just as someone was sticking
    up a notice, 'Flat to Let,' in one of the windows. There was a
    beast of a man on the other side of the street and he simply
    leapt across the road. I slipped, or I should have beaten him.
    As it was he got to the door a yard ahead of me. We looked over
    the flat together, but of course he was first, and he said he
    was sure it would suit him, only he must ask his wife. It was
    awful! I felt as if I must kill him."</p>

    <p>"So you followed him out and pushed him down the lift-shaft?
    My dear brave girl!"</p>

    <p>"No, but I heard him say he could be back in half-an-hour. I
    knew I could do it in twenty-five minutes. Look!" Betty crushed
    my hand as in a vice. "There he is."</p>

    <p>As we took a corner on two wheels I looked out and saw a man
    running. "Taxi!" he shouted in the hoarse voice of despair. Our
    driver sat like a graven image and we swept on in triumph.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" cried Betty suddenly, "suppose that, after all,
    somebody else&mdash;&mdash;" She choked on a sob.</p>

    <p>"Courage, dear heart," I said. "All is not yet lost."</p>

    <p>A moment later we had reached Victory Mansions and made a
    dash for the flat.</p>

    <p>"Are we in time?" asked Betty as the door was opened.</p>

    <p>"I think so, Ma'am," said the smiling maid and ushered us
    into the presence of the out-going tenant. A tour of the rooms
    at express speed showed the flat to be a desirable one enough.
    There were three years to run and the rent was not
    extortionate&mdash;for the times.</p>

    <p>"I'll sign the agreement now," said I.</p>

    <p>"Half-a-minute," said the out-going tenant as he produced
    the documents; "I'll get a pen and ink."</p>

    <p>The whirr of an electric bell resounded through the
    flat.</p>

    <p>"Quick!" panted Betty. "Your fountain pen." I produced it
    and wrote my name with a hand trembling with eagerness.</p>

    <p>"A gentleman about the flat, Sir," said the maid, and,
    haggard, pale and exhausted, our defeated rival staggered into
    the room.</p>

    <p>He looked at us with a dumb agony in his eyes, and neither
    of us two men had the courage to deal the fatal blow. It was
    Betty who spoke.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, but we've just taken this flat," she said
    sweetly, and added with true feminine cruelty, "I saw it first,
    you know."</p>

    <p>The stranger lost control and crashed badly on the
    hearth-rug.</p>

    <p>"Poor man," said Betty to the late tenant. "Be kind to him
    for our sakes." Then she led the way to our cab.</p>

    <p>"Hotel Splendid!" I said magnificently to the driver.</p>

    <p>"Wot," he growled, "not in them slippers?"</p>

    <p>"True," I said, with what dignity I could muster, and gave
    him the address of our lodgings.</p>

    <p>"None the less," I said to Betty, "you shall lunch among the
    profiteers. This is a great day, and it is yours."</p>

    <h2>THE LAST OF THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

    <p><span class="sc">My dear Charles</span>,&mdash;In all the
    stirring history of the War I don't know which has been the
    most moving sight: the War Office trying to get me to be a
    soldier, or the War Oflice trying to get me to stop being a
    soldier.</p>

    <p>Before the late Summer of 1914, England had evinced no
    burning interest in its Henry. It had, in fact, left me to make
    my own way, contenting itself with cautioning me if I didn't
    stick to the right side of the road, or to fining me if I
    exceeded the speed limit. In August of that memorable year it
    got, you will remember, mixed up in rather a nasty bother.
    Searching for friends to get it out, it bethought itself of
    Henry, along with 499,999 others whose names for the moment I
    do not recall. Between us (with subsequent assistance) we set
    things to rights, and nothing remained for Old England save to
    rid itself gracefully of what remained of its few millions of
    new-found friends. There was, however, no shaking off its bosom
    pal, Henry. I am one of those loyal characters whose affection,
    once gained, nothing can undo. No use saying to me: "Well, old
    man, it's getting late now; you must come and see us again some
    other day." I am one of the sort who answer: "Don't you worry
    yourself about that. I'm going to stay and go on seeing you
    now."</p>

    <p>In the early days of demobilisation there was, I think, a
    certain novelty and attraction about my attitude to the
    problem. In contrast to the impatient hordes crowding the
    entrance of the War Office, ringing the front-door bell
    violently, tapping on the window-panes and generally disturbing
    that serene atmosphere of peace which was the great feature of
    the War in Whitehall, it was refreshing to think of Henry,
    plugging quietly away elsewhere at his military duties,
    undeterred by armistices, peaces and things of that kind. I
    fancy I was well thought of in those days at the War House.</p>

    <p>"Say what you like about him," I can hear A.G.4 remarking to
    M.S.19 (decimal 9 recurring) as they met in the corridor on
    their way to lunch, "but I find him a patient, well-behaved
    young fellow."</p>

    <p>"Yes," would be the thoughtful answer, "it seems almost a
    pity we are going to lose him."</p>

    <p>Speaking strictly between ourselves, I have never thought
    much of the Military Secretary branch. What made them think
    they were going to lose me as easily as all that?</p>

    <p>What I said to myself was: "Henry, my lad, thirteen
    shillings and elevenpence a day is thirteen shillings and
    elevenpence a day; now isn't it? And war isn't war when there
    is a peace coming on. Why then throw up a fat income just for
    the sake of getting into long trousers? You stay where you are
    till they come and fetch you."</p>

    <p>So I just stayed where I was, and I conducted the operation
    with such ability and tact that Whitehall came to forget all
    about me. My name went on appearing, with ever-increasing
    dignity and beauty, in the Army List; but that made no
    difference. You see, though lots of people write the Army List,
    no one ever reads it; only from time to time a man will
    surreptitiously turn up his own name, just to renew his feeling
    of self-importance, or in an emergency he will look up the name
    of a friend in order to get the right initials after it and not
    risk giving that personal offence which may prevent the
    loan....</p>

    <p>But when I say that I stayed where I was I don't mean to
    suggest that I didn't go on leave in the usual way. Indeed I
    often came home, in full regimentals, too, partly to impress
    you and partly to travel first-class at your expense.
    Fellow-passengers never thought of turning on me and rending
    me, as being the cause of six-shillings-in-the-pound. They
    would be extremely polite
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"
       id="page225"></a>[pg 225]</span> and make friendly
       conversation with me, leading up to the point that they had
       been soldiers themselves once, but had given it up, owing to
       having been told that the War was finished.</p>

    <p>I would be just as polite to them, telling them they might
    count on me to return to the discomforts and risks of civil
    life as soon as I could be spared from the front. They had
    never the intelligence, or daring to ask, "The front of
    what?"</p>

    <p>Now the climax has arrived; I am asked if they must throw me
    out or will I go quietly? I fancy I have been caught by one of
    those card-indexes. I suspect some Departmental General of
    showing off to a friend. "This is my <span class="sc">in</span>
    basket," I can hear him explaining as he shows his audience his
    office; "every letter which comes in goes into the
    <span class="sc">in</span>. That is my
    <span class="sc">out</span> basket, and every letter which goes
    out goes out of the <span class="sc">out</span>.</p>

    <p>"And then, Sir, we have the Card Index. A complete record of
    every officer in the Army, permanent or temporary."</p>

    <p>"Are there still temporary officers in the Army?" asks the
    audience, not being able to think of anything better to ask,
    and clearly being called upon to ask something.</p>

    <p>"Sergeant-Major, turn up 'Officers, army, temporary, the,
    in,' for this gentleman."</p>

    <p>And thus the shameful truth comes out. One card
    only&mdash;mine.</p>

    <p>Exit audience wondering what manner of intrepid man this
    Henry might be.</p>

    <p>Originally the W.O. had had a great idea; they caused my
    regiment softly and silently to vanish away, thinking that I
    would vanish with it. But I had been too sharp for them.
    Learning that they were bent on "disembodying" me, and not
    liking the sound of the word, I had very quietly removed myself
    from my regiment to the Staff. Thus for a few happy months we
    see the W.O. rendered inert.</p>

    <p>My final defeat was due to a chance remark of my own, made
    to one of the fifty-nine officers under whose direct command I
    served. Upon my first arriving on his Staff he had said to me,
    "Oh, by the way, P.S.C., of course?" Quite affable, frank and
    to the point; "P.S.C., of course?"</p>

    <p>Not knowing the language, I could not make an equally
    affable answer. I asked him to repeat the question, but to
    change the code.</p>

    <p>"You have Passed Staff College, of course?" he said a little
    less affably.</p>

    <p>I then had the misfortune to answer: "Why, of course, if you
    mean that tall building on the right as I came up here from the
    station?"</p>

    <p>He then made up his mind that I was not only wanting in
    essential parts, but was also the sort of person who jested on
    religious subjects. He never forgot the matter; indeed, when
    applied to (under "Secret and Confidential" cover) to suggest a
    means of getting rid of me, he very clearly remembered it. At
    once every department in the War House got busy; the interest
    of the Secretary of State was enlisted, and the War Cabinet
    decided that for permanent purposes my post must necessarily be
    held by a P.S.C. man. Done in by what was little better, when
    you come to think of it, than a mere postscript.</p>

    <p>Please understand that there was no talk of discharging me;
    no talk of demobilising me; no talk even of disembodying me.
    Without any reflection on my conduct and merely upon the
    grounds that, not being P.S.C., I could not be regarded as
    quite right in the head, they intimated their intention of
    vacating my appointment by the simple process of an
    advertisement in the fashionable columns of <i>The London
    Gazette</i>.</p>

    <p>"What happens next?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"You will return to regimental duty," they said.</p>

    <p>"But there isn't any regiment," I pointed out triumphantly,
    "therefore there won't be any duty."</p>

    <p>They didn't seem to mind that, and for some time I wondered
    why. Then a thought occurred to me.</p>

    <p>"But here, I say, what about my pay?"</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said they unhelpfully....</p>

    <p>And that, my dear Charles, is why, if you keep your eye on
    the journals of (say) the Summer of 1925, you will read in the
    Stop-press Column an urgent telegram from the W.O.: "On April
    1st, 1920, the following relinquishes his appointment</p>

    <p>(Remaining, however,<br />
    <span style="margin-left:10em;">Yours always),</span><br />

    <h2>THE GENIUS OF MR. BRADSHAW.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>By our Literary Expert.</i>)</p>

    <p>No one will be surprised to hear that the Christian name of
    Mr. <span class="sc">Bradshaw</span> was George. Indeed, it is
    difficult to think what other name a man of his calibre could
    have had. But many people will be surprised to hear that Mr.
    <span class="sc">Bradshaw</span> is no longer alive. Whatever
    one thinks of his work one is inclined to think of him as a
    living personality, working laboriously at some
    terminus&mdash;probably at the Charing Cross Hotel. But it is
    not so. He died, in fact, in 1853. His first book&mdash;or
    rather the first edition of his book<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       was published in 1839; yet, unlike the author, it still
       lives. He is, in fact, the supreme example of the posthumous
       serial writer. I have no information about Mr.
       <span class="sc">Debrett</span> and Mr.
       <span class="sc">Burke</span>, but the style and substance
       of their work are relatively so flimsy that one is
       justified, I think, in neglecting them. In any case their
       public is a limited one. So, of course, is Mr.
       <span class="sc">Bradshaw's</span>; but it is better than
       theirs. Mr. <span class="sc">Debrett's</span> book we read
       idly in an idle hour; when we read Mr.
       <span class="sc">Bradshaw's</span> it is because we feel
       that we simply must; and that perhaps is the surest test of
       genius.</p>

    <p>It is no wonder that in some circles Mr.
    <span class="sc">Bradshaw</span> holds a position comparable
    only to the position of <span class="sc">Homer</span>. I once
    knew an elderly clergyman who knew the whole of Mr.
    <span class="sc">Bradshaw's</span> book by heart. He could tell
    you without hesitation the time of any train from anywhere to
    anywhere else. He looked forward each month to the new number,
    as other people look forward to the new numbers of magazines.
    When it came he skimmed eagerly through its pages and noted
    with a fierce excitement that they had taken off the 5.30 from
    Larne Harbour, or that the 7.30 from Galashiels was stopping
    that month at Shankend. He knew all the connections; he knew
    all the restaurant trains; and, if you mentioned the 6.15 to
    Little Buxton, he could tell you offhand whether it was a
    Saturdays Only or a Saturdays Excepted.</p>

    <p>This is the exact truth, and I gathered that he was not
    unique. It seems that there is a Bradshaw cult; there may even
    be a Bradshaw club, where they meet at intervals for Bradshaw
    dinners, after which a paper is read on "Changes I have made,
    with some Observations on Salisbury." I suppose some of them
    have first editions, and talk about them very proudly; and they
    have hot academic discussions on the best way to get from
    Barnham Junction to Cardiff without going through Bristol. Then
    they drink the toast of "The Master" and go home in omnibuses.
    My friend was a schoolmaster and took a small class of boys in
    Bradshaw; he said they knew as much about it as he did. I call
    that corrupting the young.</p>

    <p>But apart from this little band of admirers I am afraid that
    the book does suffer from neglect. Who is there, for example,
    who has read the "Directions" on page 1, where we are actually
    shown the method of reading tentatively suggested by the author
    himself? The ordinary reader, coming across a certain kind of
    thin line, lightly dismisses it as a misprint or a restaurant
    car on Fridays. If he had read the Preface he would know that
    it meant a <span class="sc">shunt</span>. He would know that a
    <span class="sc">shunt</span> means that passengers are enabled
    to continue their journey by changing into the next train.
    Whether he would know what that means I do not know. The best
    authorities suppose it to be a poetical way of saying that you
    have to change&mdash;what is called an euphemism.</p>

    <p>No, you must not neglect the Preface; and you must not
    neglect the Appendix on Hotels. As sometimes happens in works
    of a philanthropic character, Mr.
    <span class="sc">Bradshaw's</span> Appendix has a human charm
    that is lacking in his treatment of his principal theme, the
    arrival and departure of trains. To the careful student it
    reveals also a high degree of organisation among his
    collaborators, the hotel-managers. It is obvious, for example,
    that at Bournemouth there must be at least one hotel which has
    the finest situation on the South coast. Indeed one would
    expect to find that there was more than one. But no;
    Bournemouth, exceptionally fortunate in having at once the most
    select hotel on the South coast, the largest and best-appointed
    hotel on the South coast and the largest and most up-to-date
    hotel on the South coast, has positively only one which has the
    finest position on the South coast. Indeed, there is only one
    of these in the whole of England, though there are two which
    have the finest position on the East coast.</p>

    <p>How is it, we wonder, that with so much variation on a
    single theme such artistic restraint is achieved? It is clear,
    I think, that before they send in their manuscripts the
    hotel-managers must meet somewhere and agree together the exact
    terms of their contributions to the book. "The George" agrees
    that for the coming year "The Crown" shall have the "finest
    cuisine in England," provided "The George" may have "the most
    charming situation imaginable," and so on. I should like to be
    at one of those meetings.</p>

    <p>This is the only theory which accounts for the curious
    phrases we find so frequently in the
    text:&mdash;"<i>Acknowledged</i> to be the finest";
    "<i>Admittedly</i> in the best position." Who is it that
    acknowledges or admits these things? It must be the other
    managers at these annual meetings. Yes, the restraint of the
    collaborators is wonderful, and in one point only has it broken
    down. There are no fewer than seventeen hotels with an
    Unrivalled Situation, and two of these are at Harrogate. For a
    small place like the British Isles it seems to me that this is
    too many.</p>

    <p>For the rest, what imagery, what exaltation we find in this
    Appendix! Dazed with imagined beauty we pass from one splendid
    haunt to another. One of them has <i>three</i> golf-courses of
    its own; several are <i>replete</i> with every comfort (and is
    not "replete" the perfect epithet?). Here is a seductive one
    "on the sea-edge," and another whose principal glory is its
    sanitary certificate. Another stands on the spot where
    <span class="sc">Tennyson</span> received his inspiration for
    the <i>Idylls of the King</i>, and leaves it at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"
       id="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span> <!-- page 228 blank-->
    that. In such a spot even "cuisine" is negligible.</p>

    <p>On the whole, from a literary point of view, the hydros come
    out better than the mere hotels. But of course they have
    unequalled advantages. With such material as Dowsing Radiant
    Heat, D'Arsonval High Frequency and Fango Mud Treatment almost
    any writer could be sensational. What is High Frequency, I
    wonder? It is clear, at any rate, that it would be madness to
    have a hydro without it.</p>

    <p>Well, I have selected my hotel&mdash;on purely literary
    grounds. Or rather I have selected two. One is the place where
    they have the Famous Whirlpool Baths. I shall go there at
    once.</p>

    <p>The manager of the other is a great artist; alone among the
    collaborators he understands simplicity. His contribution
    occupies a whole page; but there is practically nothing in it,
    nothing about cuisine or sanitation, or elegance or comfort.
    Only, in the middle, he writes quite simply
    <span class="sc">The Most Perfect Hotel in the
    World</span>.</p>

    <h2>AN INTER-SERVICE MATCH.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>With the British Army in France</i>.)</p>

    <p>Frederick entered the Mess with a decided sea-roll, hitched
    his slacks and berthed himself on the starboard settee.</p>

    <p>"Cheerio, my hearties," said he breezily. "Everybody on the
    old lugger still luffing along all serene?"</p>

    <p>"Why so oppressively nautical?" inquired Percival. "You
    haven't been on the leave-boat lately."</p>

    <p>"'Tis true, old messmate. I'm under the influence of my new
    batman, one 'Enery 'Enson. After a lifetime in the Marines he's
    now spending his declining days in the Army, and he's terribly
    infectious. I found myself saying, 'Ay, ay, Sir,' when the C.O.
    spoke to me."</p>

    <p>"I think I've noticed your 'Enery," said Percival. "Isn't he
    about ten feet high by six broad, tattooed all over like a
    circulating art gallery, and addicted to chewing quids and
    swabbing out your hut in his bare feet?"</p>

    <p>"My cabin, you mean. And says he's going ashore when he
    takes a trip down the village. That's 'Enery."</p>

    <p>"Incidentally he's a confirmed bath-lifter," interjected
    Binnie. "Yesterday morning my batman prepared me a tub, and
    while he was fetching me along your hulking pirate boosted out
    my sponge and towels and installed your lily-white self in it.
    You were so busy wallowing in my hot water that you never heard
    my protests on the door. You really must curb his buccaneering
    instincts, old Tirps."</p>

    <p>"I accept no responsibility for his methods," said Frederick
    haughtily; "I merely profit by them. In any case I didn't
    <i>take</i> your hot water; I simply used it. You should live
    near the bath-house and get up promptly when you are called, as
    I do."</p>

    <p>"Well, I don't mind the British Navy ruling the waves,"
    grumbled Binnie, "but I object to its extending its sphere of
    influence over my bath-water."</p>

    <p>"It jolly well doesn't extend over mine," said Percival with
    pride. "Frederick's 'Enery doesn't get the better of my Elfred.
    This morning a queue, consisting of two perfectly good Loots, a
    really excellent Skipper and a priceless Major were waiting for
    vacant baths. But was Elfred Fry dismayed? To forestall an
    answer that might possibly be wrong I may say that he wasn't.
    He promptly appropriated a cubicle that happened to be
    unoccupied&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Really, my frowsty old Camembert, don't ask us to believe
    that they had <i>all</i> overlooked it," expostulated
    Frederick.</p>

    <p>"Not for worlds would I endeavour to impose on your gentle
    trusting natures. So far from their overlooking it the bath had
    been the subject of earnest scrutiny, and they had all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"
       id="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span> regretfully come to the
       conclusion that it lacked one important attribute of a
       bath&mdash;it wouldn't hold water. The plug was
       missing."</p>

    <p>"And by a singular chance the plug happened to be in the
    possession of your Elfred?"</p>

    <p>"That is my case, me luds," said Percival simply. "If the
    silent Navy wants to beat my Elfred it's got to rise very early
    in the morning."</p>

    <p>"We shall see," said Frederick darkly. "I'm going to tell
    this tale to the Marines."</p>

    <p>That evening the troops had organised a stupendous boxing
    tournament in the Recreation Hut. Binnie by invitation combined
    the offices of referee, M.C. and timekeeper, and Frederick and
    Percival at the ring-side unanimously disagreed with his
    verdicts.</p>

    <p>"Most appalling decision," said Percival in a loud whisper.
    "The referee has obviously been got at."</p>

    <p>"Sh!" replied Frederick. "He hasn't been told it's a boxing
    contest. He thinks it's a clog-dancing competition and is
    giving the points for footwork."</p>

    <p>Unfortunately the M.C. did not hear. He was speaking
    himself.</p>

    <p>"The next bout should conclude our programme," he said, "but
    I am asked to announce that Private Henson challenges Private
    Fry to box six two-minute rounds, backing himself for five
    francs against a small article of no intrinsic value."</p>

    <p>Enthusiastic applause greeted the announcement. A
    disturbance in the rear of the hut indicated that Elfred was
    heading for cover.</p>

    <p>"'E 's twice my size," he wailed as strong hands hauled him
    back.</p>

    <p>"The challenger admits that he holds a slight advantage in
    weight," continued the M.C., "but considers that is
    counterbalanced by his advanced years."</p>

    <p>"This is <i>your</i> fiendish work," hissed Percival to
    Frederick.</p>

    <p>"Not a bit of it, old sportsman," replied Frederick
    cheerfully. "The patent rights are held by 'Enery. I merely
    mentioned to him that Elfred possessed a desirable bath-plug
    that it might be useful to acquire."</p>

    <p>Percival left his seat to confer with the shrinking
    Elfred.</p>

    <p>"'E can 'ave the old bath-plug an' welcome, Sir, as far as
    I'm concerned," said the latter.</p>

    <p>"Tut, tut!" said Percival. "You must make a fight for it.
    The honour of the Army is at stake."</p>

    <p>"I ain't all that set on the honour of the Army," said
    Elfred. "But 'im being the challenger, shouldn't I be justified
    in putting the plug in one of my gloves?"</p>

    <p>"The rules don't provide for such a contingency. Hurry up
    now and get stripped, and I'll give you twenty francs if you
    win."</p>

    <p>Both combatants were warmly received. 'Enery's decorative
    tattooing was much admired, and Elfred was urgently requested
    not to spoil the pictures. By desire of the referee the stakes
    were handed to him&mdash;Frederick producing the five francs
    for 'Enery&mdash;and the battle commenced.</p>

    <p>It was early evident that the Navy intended shock tactics,
    while the Army favoured a system of elastic defence. A salvo of
    short-arm jabs by 'Enery was answered by long-range sniping on
    the part of Elfred, no direct hits being recorded. Towards the
    end of the round 'Enery attempted to approach under cover of a
    smoke screen, but action was broken off at the sound of the
    gong.</p>

    <p>The second round opened sensationally. Elfred, on the advice
    of his seconds, was "making use of the ring" when he
    accidentally collided with his opponent coming in the reverse
    direction and gave him a violent thump without return. There
    seemed every prospect of trouble, but clever footwork prevented
    the incident developing into a <i>fracas</i>. Round two
    concluded with Elfred leading handsomely by one point to
    nothing.</p>

    <p>"Two to one on Elfred," said Percival excitedly.</p>

    <p>"Take you&mdash;in bath plugs," answered Frederick,
    carefully entering the bet.</p>

    <p>'Enery equalised in the third round, Elfred having
    incautiously wandered <span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"
       id="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span> into the track of a stray
       upper-cut and bounced off. More footwork followed, Elfred
       winning by about two yards. Both were breathing heavily when
       time was called, and 'Enery was complaining about his
       bronchitis.</p>

    <p>Skirmishing tactics in the fourth round resulted in Elfred
    having a narrow escape from being torpedoed beneath the belt,
    and during several subsequent clinches he was requested to stop
    studying the pictures and get on with the business.</p>

    <p>The fifth and sixth rounds were marked by the departure of
    most of the spectators, and in the end a draw was the only
    possible verdict.</p>

    <p>"But what about the plug, old scout?" asked Percival, as
    they wandered back to their quarters.</p>

    <p>"As referee," answered Binnie, "I gave a draw; as Battalion
    Boxing Board of Control I order the match to be re-fought in
    six months' time, to give the men a chance to get into
    condition; and meanwhile as stakeholder I continue to hold the
    five francs and the bath-plug."</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, March 15th</i>. The great Food-prices debate
    hardly justified its preliminary advertisement. Mr.
    <span class="sc">McCurdy</span> took sure ground when he argued
    that high prices were mainly due to world-shortage; and, though
    he entered more disputable territory when he declared that the
    Profiteering Act was not primarily intended to punish
    profiteers, Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> did not
    seriously attempt to dislodge him. Indeed, the
    <span class="sc">ex-Premier's</span> speech was mainly composed
    of truisms, his only excursion into the speculative being an
    assertion&mdash;with which not all economists will
    agree&mdash;that inflation of currency is a consequence and not
    a cause of high prices.</p>

    <p>An ex-Food Controller, Mr. <span class="sc">George
    Roberts</span>, defended the Government against charges of
    extravagance, and ventured to remind Labour&mdash;as
    <span class="sc">Thomas Drummond</span> reminded Irish
    landlords&mdash;that it had duties as well as rights.</p>

    <p>Early in the evening the <span class="sc">Prime
    Minister</span>, who had sat through many speeches in readiness
    for the threatened attack, folded his notes and silently stole
    away.</p>

    <p>On the adjournment General <span class="sc">Page
    Croft</span> accused the Ministry of Munitions of unfair
    treatment to one of its employees. The peroration to Mr.
    <span class="sc">Kellaway's</span> spirited defence deserves
    quotation: "The decision taken by the Ministry is a decision
    that will stand." That's the stuff to give 'em.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday, March 16th</i>.&mdash;"The <span class="sc">Lord
    Chancellor</span> was so unusually apologetic in his exposition
    of the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill that none of the
    Peers had the heart seriously to oppose him. Lord
    <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> took note of the Government's
    admission that they were anxious to say Good-bye to D.O.R.A.
    and only complained that the farewell ceremony was so
    long-drawn-out. Lord <span class="sc">Buckmaster</span> failed
    to understand why D.O.R.A. should have a longer life in Ireland
    than in England, and was so carried away by his own eloquence
    as to declare that all the crimes attributed to the Sinn
    Feiners had been due "to misguided attempts to enforce special
    legislation against a misunderstood and a gallant people." Lord
    <span class="sc">Birkenhead</span> replied that there was at
    least a plausible case for the contention that the boot was on
    the other leg.</p>

    <p>It is unusual to find Members of the House of Commons
    objecting to their speeches being reported, but apparently some
    of them do&mdash;when the reporters are police constables. The
    <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> thought it quite
    possible that if Members attended certain meetings the official
    stenographers might think it worth while to take down their
    utterances but I gathered that he was not prepared to give any
    guarantee on the subject, and that Colonel
    <span class="sc">Wedgwood</span> and Lieut.-Commander
    <span class="sc">Kenworthy</span> must not count too
    confidently on having a further road to fame opened to
    them.</p>

         Sir Robert Horne.</span>
    </div>

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> read a telegram from
    Lord <span class="sc">Kilmarnock</span> regarding the situation
    in Berlin. As it was already a day old, was admittedly based on
    a <i>communiqué</i> from <i>Wolff's Bureau</i>, "censored" by
    Mr. <span class="sc">Trebitsch Lincoln</span> (late Liberal
    Member for Darlington), and had in the meantime been officially
    contradicted by the old Government, it did not add much to our
    knowledge.</p>

    <p>Time was when it was usual to move to reduce a Vote by a
    hundred pounds if you wanted to defeat the Government. But such
    paltry figures are no good in these spacious days. Sir
    <span class="sc">Donald Macleans's</span> proposed reduction in
    the Vote on Account for the Civil Services was the much more
    mouth-filling morsel of one hundred million pounds. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> considered it very handsome
    of the Opposition, on the eve, he understood, of coming into
    office, thus to cut off its own supplies. Nevertheless he
    declined to accept the generous offer. Our finances would be
    all right if the House would back the Government by practising
    economy as well as preaching it. As it was, he thought the
    worst was over, for&mdash;strange and agreeable
    phenomenon&mdash;the floating debt was sinking.</p>

    <p>After this it was, perhaps, not very complimentary'of Mr.
    <span class="sc">J.W. Wilson</span> to urge the Government to
    put forth their best speakers. The <span class="sc">Prime
    Minister</span> was still coy, but Sir <span class="sc">Robert
    Horne</span>, in virtue of his new office as President of the
    Board of Trade, stepped nimbly into the breach, and made a
    speech so cheerful both in substance and delivery as to justify
    the hope that in him the Government have found the
    <span class="sc">Horne</span> of Plenty.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, March 17th</i>.&mdash;Seventeen years ago Lord
    <span class="sc">Balfour of Burleigh</span>, as a hard-shell
    Free Trader, sacrificed office sooner than bow the knee to the
    new gods of Birmingham. This afternoon he brought in a Bill (to
    safeguard "key industries" and counteract "dumping") which
    would have gladdened the heart of Mr. <span class="sc">Joseph
    Chamberlain</span>. Some of the other Free Trade Peers were
    still unrepentant. Lord <span class="sc">Beauchamp</span>, for
    example, declaring that shipping was our real "quay-industry"
    and needed no protection, announced his intention of moving the
    rejection of the Bill; and Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"
       id="page234"></a>[pg 234]</span> although one of the authors
       of the Paris resolutions, on which the measure was
       ostensibly based, thought that it went far beyond present
       necessities. The only dumps with which Germany was likely to
       be associated for some time to come were doleful, not
       aggressive.</p>

    <p>The Report of the Supplementary Estimates furnished the
    Commons with abundant points for criticism. In protesting
    against an increase in the remuneration of the Law Officers,
    Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span> revealed a hitherto
    unsuspected admiration for the <span class="sc">Prime
    Minister</span>, whose services, he considered, were most
    inadequately rewarded with five thousand pounds a year and no
    pension. If anyone deserved an increase of salary it was
    he.</p>

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Tyson-Wilson</span> had the temerity to
    complain that the Government were not finding work for all the
    disabled ex-Service men whom they trained in the technical
    schools, and laid himself open to a damaging "<i>tu quoque</i>"
    from Sir <span class="sc">Robert Horne</span>, who pointed out
    that this lack of employment was largely due to the trade
    unions, which refused to admit these men as "improvers."</p>

    <p>In introducing the Naval Estimates for eighty odd millions
    Mr. <span class="sc">Long</span> was almost apologetic for not
    having made them larger. The <i>personnel</i> has been
    drastically reduced, and parents are actually being offered a
    premium of three hundred pounds to remove their sons from
    Osborne. On the other hand promotion from the lower deck was to
    be encouraged, and in future every youngster entering the Navy
    would metaphorically carry a broad-pennant in his
    ditty-box.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, March 18th</i>.&mdash;A proposal to erect a
    military monument on a hill near Jerusalem was adversely
    criticised by Lord <span class="sc">Treowen</span>. Lord
    <span class="sc">Southborough</span>, as a recent visitor to
    the Holy City, thought that the Government would be better
    advised to demolish some of the recent buildings, including the
    ex-Kaiser's ridiculous clock-tower, which had not even the
    negative merit of telling the time.</p>

    <p>In consequence of his rather exhausting séance with the
    Liberal Party the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> was
    looking a little jaded. But he perked up wonderfully when Mr.
    <span class="sc">Will Thorne</span>, <i>à propos</i> of a story
    that the Russian Soviet Government had introduced martial law
    into the workshops, asked whether he did not think that all
    able-bodied people ought to be compelled to work. There was the
    old twinkle in his eyes as he replied that it would be very
    interesting to know if that was the view of the trade unions.
    From recent information I gather that the bricklayers, at any
    rate, would not subscribe to it.</p>

    <p>Upon the further consideration of the Navy Estimates General
    <span class="sc">Seely</span> urged the re-establishment of the
    Committee of Imperial Defence. Mr. <span class="sc">Long</span>
    said the Admiralty were most anxious for it. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Asquith</span> also approved, but from his ten
    years' experience as its President entered a <i>caveat</i>
    against expecting the Committee to take upon itself executive
    functions. "Had it done so," he observed, "there would have
    been collisions, cross-purposes, waste of application, and in
    many cases something approaching to administrative confusion."
    Which things of course never occurred under his <i>régime</i>
    of&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;expectant watchfulness.</p>

    <p>The rest of the debate was chiefly remarkable for Lady
    <span class="sc">Astor's</span> bold declaration, "The sea
    belongs to England, and it could not be in better hands."
    Coming from a country-woman of Mr.
    <span class="sc">Daniels</span> it was doubly exhilarating.</p>

    <h3>THE LATEST PARTY.</h3>

    <p class="center">(<i>Being the Diary of a well-intentioned
    Voter</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>Monday</i>. Important article in my morning paper on the
    serious political outlook. Recommends the formation of a new
    party to carry out progressive reforms and combat the forces of
    Revolution and Anarchy. Sounds excellent. The new party is to
    be called the People's Party. I decide to join it.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;By a fortunate mistake my newsagent
    placed wrong paper on my step to-day. Find I was being misled
    by the sheet I usually take. A new party to carry out
    progressive reforms and combat the forces of Revolution and
    Anarchy has already been formed. It is called the National
    Party. I decide to join it.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Attended public meeting advertised
    as being in support of the new party. Expected to hear all
    about the programme of the National Party. Instead was urged to
    join the Modern Party, to carry out progressive reforms and
    combat the forces of Revolution and Anarchy. Signed card before
    leaving the hall pledging my support.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Dined with Brooks, who takes very
    grave view of the state of the country. Said what we really
    want is a new party. Went on to outline some urgent progressive
    reforms and mentioned one or two necessary steps for combating
    the forces of Revolution and Anarchy. Suggested that he and I
    should try to start a local branch of the Britannic Party.
    Seemed so enthusiastic that I hadn't the heart to refuse
    him.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Johnson called at the office during my
    busiest hour. Wanted to enrol me as a member of a new party, to
    be known as the Efficiency Party. No time to go into it
    properly, so agreed, to get rid of him. Anyhow, the object's a
    good one. It was something about progressive reforms and
    combating the forces of Revolution and Anarchy.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Heard at the Club that if the
    Coalition is not better supported in their attempts to carry
    out progressive reforms and combat the forces of Revolution and
    Anarchy, they will form themselves into a new party and go to
    the country. Locally we are to have, in addition to the
    retiring Coalitionist, a Free Liberal candidate, a Labour Party
    candidate, a couple of Independent candidates, a People's Party
    candidate, a National Party candidate, a Modern Party
    candidate, a Britannic Party candidate, and an Efficiency Party
    candidate. Afraid this would make my position extremely
    complicated. Decide to give undivided support to the Coalition
    in the hope of averting a General Election.</p>

    <h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

    <h4 class="sc">"The Truth About The Russian Dancers."</h4>

    <p>With that uncanny tuition of his Sir <span class="sc">James
    Barrie</span> has, of course, hit on the precise truth. Russian
    dancers are not born but made&mdash;by the <i>Maestro</i>,
    which I take it is (broadly speaking) Italian for Producer and
    Presenter.</p>

    <p>When <i>Karissima</i> goes on a visit to the stately home of
    the <i>Veres</i> the peace of that ancient haunt of the
    conventionally correct is queerly broken. Young <i>Lord
    Vere</i> loses his heart. However, that might just as easily or
    more easily have happened if the Gaiety had been invited. But a
    dreadful change comes to <i>Uncle Bill</i>&mdash;he buys his
    clothes ready-made (at <i>La boutique fantasque</i>, for a
    guess, or possibly Mr.
    <span class="sc">Mallaby-Deeley's</span>), grows dundrearies
    and goes hopelessly off his game at golf.</p>

    <p><i>Karissima</i>, poor dear, can't walk or talk or putt, for
    that matter, except with her toes. <i>Bill</i> calls this last
    cheating, but young <i>Vere</i> thinks it simply
    adorable&mdash;as do we all. <i>Lady Vere</i>, his mother,
    can't get used to being kissed by <i>Karissima</i>, who
    <i>will</i> stand upon her lightly with one foot, oddly waving
    the other meanwhile in the air. Besides it takes too long and
    <i>is</i> rather too demonstrative. And couldn't
    <i>Karissima</i> dear just try to walk with her soles really
    flat on the ground in the solid English county way? Certainly.
    <i>Karissima</i> will try, to please Madame, and with painful
    effort achieves a half-dozen clumsy steps till unconquerable
    habit and Mr. <span class="sc">Arnold Bax's</span> allusively
    witty music lift her on tiptoe again. And really she is such a
    darling that the once reluctant dowager finally consents to the
    marriage; wedding bells forthwith (within); a white-haired
    clergyman, surprised at nothing, as becomes the very best type
    of padre, appears; follow <i>corps de ballet</i> bridesmaids;
    and <i>Bill</i> gives her away.</p>

    <p><i>Karissima</i>, says <i>Vere</i> to <i>Maestro</i> later
    in the evening, is depressed. Because she hasn't a child. They
    both tremendously want a child. <i>Maestro</i>, silently
    showing his watch-dial, would seem to wish to suggest that they
    were unreasonably impatient. <i>Karissima</i> also pleads.
    Well, he will see what he can do. But there's an awful penalty.
    For a new Russian dancer cannot be made unless another
    surrenders life. Anyway he fetches his black bag. And
    <i>Karissima</i> dances down the main staircase with her babe,
    who grows apace and is shortly seen prancing in the garden (on
    his toes&mdash;"Thank Heaven!" says the <i>Maestro</i>).</p>

    <p>And <i>Karissima</i> dies and is brought in on her bier, and
    dances (she <i>would</i>!) her own funeral service.
    <i>Maestro's</i> heart is touched; he lies down in her stead,
    and she, dancing on a carpet of thistle-down shot with stars (I
    think), and her lord (I am sure), perpetually exclaiming, "How
    perfectly topping!"&mdash;both achieve an enviable
    immortality.</p>

    <p>Madame <span class="sc">Karsavina</span> is exquisite; she
    is well supported by Mr. C.M. <span class="sc">Lowne</span>
    (<i>Hon. Bill</i>), Mr. <span class="sc">Herman de Lange</span>
    (<i>Maestro</i>), Miss G.
    <span class="sc">Sterroll</span>(<i>Dowager</i>), and Mr.
    <span class="sc">Basil Foster</span> (<i>Lord Vere</i>). And I
    thought I detected Mr. <span class="sc">Du Maurier's</span>
    appreciation of the bizarre in his production. But the triumph
    is the triumph of the whimsical author. I don't think he has
    ever done anything better; more ambitious things, yes, but
    nothing so free from flaw.</p>

    <p>Isn't it more than possible that just three-score years ago,
    on a May day (see <i>Who's Who</i>), some Maestro of Fantasy
    slipped into a little house in Kirriemuir, N.B., with a black
    bag? Wouldn't that explain the otherwise inexplicable, the
    unwearying resourcefulness, the unabashed playfulness of this
    impenitent youth?</p>

    <h2>DRAM.BAC.</h2>

    <p>A suggestion has been put forward, with the support of the
    British Drama League and others, for the establishment at our
    universities of a "Faculty of the Theatre and Dramatic Degree."
    Heartily applauding the proposal, we append a typical
    examination paper for the final school:&mdash;</p>

    <p>(1) Sketch briefly the progress of amateur acting in this
    country, from the impersonation of a Danish minstrel by
    <span class="sc">Alfred the Great</span>, to the Victory
    Varieties Matinée arranged by Lady Eve Tatlery.</p>

    <p>(2) Arrange, in order of probability, the first fifty
    authors of <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>.</p>

    <p>(3) "The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of
    Eton." Estimate the rival claims of the Windsor Strollers.</p>

    <p>(4) Indicate your make-up for <span class="sc">Romulus,
    Henry the Eighth, Abraham Lincoln</span>.</p>

    <p>(5) What is a point, and how made? A "straight" line lies
    evenly between any good points; give instances.</p>

    <p>(6) Under what dramatic conditions can a part be greater
    than the whole? Cite the authority of any two actor-managers
    for this theory.</p>

    <p>(7) Explain, with diagrams, (<i>a</i>) The Eternal Triangle;
    (<i>b</i>) Squaring the Upper Circle.</p>

    <p>(8) Illustrate the axiom that the length of a run varies
    with the breadth of the dialogue.</p>

    <p>(9) What proportion of the music-hall comedians of Great
    Britain is supplied by (<i>a</i>) Lancashire; (<i>b</i>)
    Scotland?</p>

    <p>(10) Which European drama requires most doors for its
    honeymoon farces?</p>

    <p>(11) "What Manchester thinks to-day England will think next
    Sunday evening." Analyse this statement in its bearing upon the
    play-producing societies.</p>

    <p>(12) "Let who will make a nation's laws so that I make its
    songs." Discuss the ethical and sociological significance of
    this with regard to (<i>a</i>) "Where do flies go in the
    winter-time?" (<i>b</i>) "I <i>do</i> like-an egg with my
    tea."</p>

    <p>In the <i>vivâ-voce</i> portion of the examination,
    candidates for Honours will be required to satisfy the
    examiners (to the point of actual tears) by their recital of
    selected passages from prepared books. They may offer any two
    of the following: "Buckingham's Farewell;" "The Signalman's
    Daughter;" "The Death of Little Nell" (<i>with voices</i>).</p>

    <p>For candidates not seeking Honours a passable imitation of
    Mr. <span class="sc">George Robey</span> will entitle to one
    group.</p>

    <h3>THE METHODS OF GENIUS.</h3>

    <p class="center">(<i>By our Special Literary
    Parasite</i>.)</p>

    <p>The public already know something of the painful
    difficulties under which novelists labour at the present moment
    owing to the paper shortage and the enhanced cost of book
    production. But "the economic consequences of the Peace" by no
    means exhaust the handicaps of the conscientious and sensitive
    novelist. We are glad therefore to note the efforts of <i>The
    Daily Graphic</i> to enlist the sympathy of the public on
    behalf of this sorely tried and meritorious class. Our
    contemporary tells us, for example, of one momentous writer who
    was reduced to dictating blindfold "because the facial
    peculiarities of first one and then another amanuensis" upset
    her equanimity. Then there is the tragic story of Mr.
    <span class="sc">R.L. Hitchens</span>, who, being engaged to
    write an article against time, sent out for a stenographer, who
    on arrival proved to be a man with a large black beard of so
    sinister an aspect that Mr. <span class="sc">Hichins</span> was
    forced to dismiss him and write the article in his own hand.
    Yet Mr. <span class="sc">Hichens</span> is not easily put off,
    for we learn that he finds he works best in big hotels and not,
    as we might have guessed, in the sequestered tranquillity of a
    minaret.</p>

    <p>To some writers solitude is the true school of genius. Yet
    Sir <span class="sc">Lewis Morris</span> found some of his
    happiest thoughts come to him while travelling in the
    Underground, while Mr. <span class="sc">W.B. Yeats</span>
    records a similar experience as the result of a journey on the
    top of a tram-car. Your advanced modernists, with
    <span class="sc">Marinetti</span> at their head, find their
    best stimulus to creative effort in the clang and clatter of
    machinery. <i>Per contra</i>, to return to <i>The Daily
    Graphic</i>, Mrs. <span class="sc">C.N. Williamson</span> must
    have pretty things to look at "in business hours." But the
    happiest of all our authors is Madame
    <span class="sc">Albanesi</span>, who "finds her brain-spur in
    a blank sheet of paper, and not the ghost of an idea what she
    is going to write about." Less fortunate writers labour
    assiduously only to leave the minds of their readers a blank,
    without the ghost of an idea of what the author has been
    writing about.</p>

    <p>It is a pity that Mr. <span class="sc">W.L. George</span>,
    in his interesting survey of modern writers of fiction in the
    <i>English Review</i>, has told us nothing about the methods of
    the "Neo-Victorians" and "Semi-Victorians," the "Edwardians"
    and "belated Edwardians," and the "Georgians" and
    "Neo-Georgians." With all these classes he deals faithfully.
    But his criticism is purely literary. He fails to tell us the
    things that every reader wants to know. It is all very well to
    say that the neo-Georgians "paint in ink," but he ought to have
    mentioned whether it is green or red. Does Miss
    <span class="sc">Dorothy Richardson</span> dictate to the sound
    of trumpets, garbed in crimson trouserloons? Does Mr.
    <span class="sc">Arnold Bennett</span> cantillate his "copy"
    into the horn of a graphophone or use a motor-stylus? Does Mr.
    <span class="sc">Siegried Sassoon</span> beat his breast with
    one hand while he plays the loud bassoon with the other? Does
    Mr. <span class="sc">Alec Waugh</span> use sermon-paper or
    foolscap? Does Mr. <span class="sc">Aldous Huxley</span> keep a
    tame gorilla? These are the really illuminating details that we
    hunger for. Without them it is impossible to appreciate the
    artistry of our young Masters. Mr. <span class="sc">W.L.
    George</span> has given us a glimpse of the working of their
    brains; let him now reveal to us the secrets of their
    workshops.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>After the Day: Germany Unconquered and Unrepentant</i>
    (<span class="sc">Jenkins</span>) is the kind of thesis-book
    which it is wise to read in a deliberately incredulous mood.
    Mr. <span class="sc">Hayden Talbot</span> is an American
    newspaper man of immense resourcefulness but, I should judge,
    of a not conspicuously judicial habit of mind. That, perhaps,
    is hardly a newspaper man's business. He is after copy, and
    certainly there's good enough copy in his interviews with Count
    <span class="sc">Bernstorff</span> and Dr.
    <span class="sc">Rathenau</span>, and one must admire his feat
    of getting out of these and seven other German publicists,
    including <span class="sc">Maximilian Harden</span>, the draft
    of a manifesto to the people of America, composed in the hope,
    vain as it happened, that the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>
    would break his long silence and sign it. It is the author's
    theory that it is the inner camarilla, working for a speedy
    restoration of the monarchy, that is responsible for the
    certainly uncharacteristic reticence of Amerongen. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Talbot</span> also interviewed
    <span class="sc">Hindenberg</span>, whom he found a
    "broken-down, inconsequential, garrulous example of senility"
    <span class="sc">Ludendorff</span>, who was very stiff and
    proud and rude; and the <i>fiancée</i> of the man who sank the
    <i>Lusitania</i>. His general idea of Germany is summed up in
    the remark of Mr. <span class="sc">Mandelbaum</span>, of New
    York: "All this talk about Fritz being down and out is all
    bunk!" Germany is full of energy and hate; she will soon be a
    monarchy again; will undersell the world; is assiduously
    preparing for air supremacy as the way to <i>revanche</i>. I
    take it that this is not so much a book as a <i>réchauffé</i>
    of newspaper articles, which alone will account for its
    formlessness and frequent changes of plane. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Talbot</span>, confessing to a total ignorance
    of the German tongue, seems quite unconscious that this imposes
    certain limitations on his capacity to make an adequate survey
    of a difficult problem.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I may confess at once that I finished the first chapter of
    <i>The Woman of the Picture</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and
    Stoughton</span>) in a mood of slight derision, induced by Mr.
    G.F. <span class="sc">Turner's</span> allowing one hero to say
    of the other that he had "the interminable limbs" of an
    aristocrat. To the end of the book indeed I was uncertain
    whether such occasional lapses were meant to illumine the
    character of the supposed speaker or were unintentional. But
    again to quote, this time a phrase in which Mr.
    <span class="sc">Turner</span> clearly shares my own delight,
    "before we were through with the affair" such details had
    ceased to be of moment. The plain fact is that <i>The Woman of
    the Picture</i> is the most breathless, irresistible piece of
    convincing impossibility you have read for ages. I decline to
    struggle with any transcription of the plot. On the wrapper you
    will observe the woman stepping bodily out of the picture, like
    the ancestors in the whisky advertisement; this, however, is a
    symbolic rather than an actual presentment. But there is plenty
    without it: a rightful heir, mountain castles amid the eternal
    snows, a villain (with sorceries), half-a-dozen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"
       id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span> attempted murders and the
       most hair-lifting duel imaginable. Soberly considered the
       whole business is a riot of delirium, belonging flagrantly
       to that realm where all the world's a screen, and all the
       men and women merely movies. But the unexpected charm of the
       book is that with the possible exceptions noticed above) it
       is told with a touch of distinction, even of subtlety, that
       invests its wildest audacities with an atmosphere of
       fantastic truth. In short, if Mr. G.F.
       <span class="sc">Turner</span> has done nothing else he has
       at least enabled the fastidious to enjoy the thrills of a
       shocker while retaining their self-respect.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In the first of the three stories, each about a hundred
    pages in length, which make up <i>Gold and Iron</i>
    (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>), it is hard to escape the
    conviction that Mr. <span class="sc">Joseph Hergesheimer</span>
    between the lines, "So you thought that
    <span class="sc">Conrad</span> was the only
    <span class="sc">Joseph</span> who could throw a man and woman
    together on a mysterious coast in the most strangely romantic
    circumstances, and provide a thoroughly groolly scrap into the
    bargain. Well, here's another little <i>Victory</i> for you."
    He seems definitely to challenge that air of the extraordinary
    and the inevitable combined which Mr.
    <span class="sc">Conrad</span> so subtly conveys. It is a big
    effort, and I don't feel that the author quite brings it off,
    yet I cannot think of anyone but Mr.
    <span class="sc">Conrad</span> who would have come nearer to
    doing so, and the fight in the dark in this story is one that
    even after the War will make a reader catch his breath for
    half-a-dozen pages at least. In the second and third stories,
    which actually deal with gold and iron (the first of the three
    is called "Wild Oranges," though perhaps "Blood Oranges" would
    have been a better title), the writer returns to a happier
    <i>métier</i>, and deals with an America remarkably interesting
    and wholly novel to me, an America where foundries and railways
    are in their infancy and crinolines are worn. Saloons, bowie
    knives and bags of gold-dust are all too familiar to us, but
    who, on this side of the Atlantic at any rate, ever remembers
    the quiet towns with Victorian manners to which the diggers
    belonged and returned? Both "Tubal Cain" and "The Dark Fleece"
    are excellent yarns and wonderful pieces of pictorial
    reconstruction as well.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>After reading <i>The Searchers</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder
    and Stoughton</span>), I seriously think of myself joining His
    Britannic Majesty's Secret Service. All the fun and firearms,
    and ever, at the conclusion, a startling surprise for your
    friends and admirers, among whom you stand cool, calm and
    collected. <i>Anthony Keene-Leslie</i> did not deceive me when,
    upon his first introduction as a secret servant, he modestly
    disclaimed the thrills and excitements commonly attributed to
    his trade. I knew that many pages would not be turned before he
    would land us in the middle of some crimson intrigue;
    mysterious strangers, disguises, cryptic and invaluable
    manuscripts, urgent telegrams, codes, Italian hidden hands,
    Scotland Yard, pseudo-taxicabs, clues and things. But let
    others beware of Mr. <span class="sc">John Foster</span>, a
    most ingenious manipulator of the old stock-in-trade and
    possessing a rare sense of humour. For the reader to pit his
    wits against the author's is, in this instance, to be
    completely "had" and to become under the necessity (about page
    265) of taking off his hat, not only to the secret servant but
    to a mere minion of the "Yard" also. Two minor points emerge
    from a close study of the book. The first is that the author is
    undoubtedly a barrister himself; if I am wrong on this point I
    finally withdraw my threat to join the Service. The second
    point is that he knows his Scotland even as well as he loves
    it. In the result you have two merits, which together amply
    discount the element of cheap sensationalism: one merit is the
    logical development of the story, and the other is its
    beautiful setting. I don't know whether it is due to the
    Scottish climate or to the legal atmosphere that the author
    omits all reference to the feminine sex or affairs of the
    heart; but anyhow it seemed right and meet that women should be
    left at home when men were engaged upon such violent and
    dastardly business.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>From certain internal evidences, mainly orthographical, I am
    led to suppose <i>The Branding Iron</i>
    (<span class="sc">Constable</span>) to be of Transatlantic
    origin. This, no doubt, explains my unfamiliarity with the name
    of Miss <span class="sc">Katharine Newlin Burt</span>, also
    certain minor points, notably the fact that the story, though
    by no means badly told, suffers from what I can only call a
    plethora of plot. As I followed the developments of its
    intrigue and tracked the heroine from untutored savage, wife of
    the wild Westerner whose excusable suspicions caused him to
    brand her as private property, to the moment of her triumph as
    the bejewelled idol of theatrical New York, the conviction grew
    upon me that here was a tale surely predestined to be the
    screen that covers a multitude of melodramatics. Presently
    indeed the suggestion became so insistent that I went further
    and began to wonder whether I was not in fact reading a
    "story-form" of some already triumphant film. Certainly the
    resemblance is almost too pronounced to be fortuitous; from the
    sensational branding scene, through cowboy stunts, to the
    up-town playhouse, where a repentant and wife-seeking hero
    recognises his mark upon the shoulder of the leading
    lady&mdash;and so to reconciliation, slow fade-out, and the
    announcement of Next Week's Pictures. But though it is
    impossible not to suspect Miss <span class="sc">Burt</span> of
    having an eye to what poetic journalism calls the Shadow Stage,
    this is by no means to belittle her mastery of the colder
    medium of print; and I hasten to acknowledge that, upon me at
    least, <i>The Branding Iron</i> has left a distinct though
    possibly fleeting impression of good entertainment.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
